This projects include 3 modules 
1. time -> for different time function (But in this project I only use one function "time.sleep(para)" for pause the program for "para" second. (para is a parameter in int type which is the time in seconds)
2. webbrowser -> for opening browser in local system
3. from plyer we import notification -> which gives the notification in system.
